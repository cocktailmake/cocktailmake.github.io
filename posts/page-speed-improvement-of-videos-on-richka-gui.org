Like other video systems, RICHKA GUI also suffer the page loads too slowly because there are many images and videos.

Our past effort to make the page speed of video list and format list on top and edit page faster with integrating a delayed loading of video contents.

First, we introduce about videos in RICHKA SYSTEM GUI. There are 2 main pages:
+ TOP page: 
    - show generated videos. (1)

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
[[img-url:/images/page-speed-improvement-of-videos-on-richka-gui/index.png]]

    - show template videos for selecting when creating a new video data. (2)

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
[[img-url:/images/page-speed-improvement-of-videos-on-richka-gui/add_template.png]]

+ EDIT page:
    - show videos and images in scenes for generating video. (3)

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
[[img-url:/images/page-speed-improvement-of-videos-on-richka-gui/scene.png]]

    - show videos and images in library of video data, library of user, searching from videos and images side, capturing from other website, PDF file (4)

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center

    - show template videos for selecting another template as same as creating a new video data in TOP page (5)

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center
[[img-url:/images/page-speed-improvement-of-videos-on-richka-gui/change_template.png]]

    - show generated video (6)

    - show sample video (7)

* There are our improvements:
** Pagination and search
    Number of videos and images are large. Displaying all of them is too slow, so we limited the number of videos and images.


** Load the video only after loading the page
    + Except for videos and images in scenes (3), we didn't get video in loading page processing.
    + In almost of cases, we will call an Ajax for loading them.
    + The flow is:
        - After loading a page or loading popup, an Ajax will be called.
        - In the request processing, a loading page or loading icon will be displayed.
        - After response returned, hide the loading page or loading icon, then show videos and images.

** Only loading a limited number of videos
    In above improvement, in case of videos, we didn't show all of them in the same time. 
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function loadGroupVideojs(videoItems, modal_id, after_video_loading) {
    loadVideojs(videoItems, 0, modal_id, after_video_loading);
    setTimeout(loadVideojs(videoItems, 1, modal_id, after_video_loading), 50);
    setTimeout(loadVideojs(videoItems, 2, modal_id, after_video_loading), 100);
    setTimeout(loadVideojs(videoItems, 3, modal_id, after_video_loading), 150);
    setTimeout(loadVideojs(videoItems, 4, modal_id, after_video_loading), 200);
}
function loadVideojs(videoItems, index, modal_id, after_video_loading){
    var video = videoItems[index];
    ...
        var poster = video.getAttribute('xx-poster');
        if (poster === null) {
            if (video.getAttribute('preload') === 'none') {
                video.setAttribute('preload', 'metadata');
                addDurationTimeToVideo(video);
            }
        }
    ...
    index += 5;
    if (index < videoItems.length) {
        setTimeout(loadVideojs(videoItems, index, modal_id, after_video_loading), 400);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

    Like above code, we loaded five videos ~50ms~ apart. When a video is loaded, in the end of function ~loadVideojs~ will be loaded the next videos.

    Function ~loadVideojs~ will be checked video in the end of list for stopping callback.

#+ATTR_HTML: :align center

    This is the result of combining the two above features: ~Load the video only after loading the page~, ~Only loading a limited number of videos~.

** Use attribute ~preload~ and ~thumbnail~ of video tag
    All videos in RICHKA system have thumbnail image. 
    We split video into 2 types:
        + Normal video: only play
            - In this case, video tag will be rendered with 2 attributes: ~preload~ attribute is none and ~xx-poster~ attribute is video thumbnail
            - When video is visible, poster attribute will be created from ~xx-poster~      
            - When video is played, video will be loaded
        + Special video: need video information such as height, width, duration time
            - We will read video information and save to video name or database
            - When video is rendered, we will use video thumbnail and use video information to crop
            - When user hovers over a video, thumbnail image will be removed and video tag which attribute ~preload~ is ~metadata~ will be added with style of thumbnail image.

** Migrate video source from production server to AWS S3 
    The larger the number of users, the larger the number of videos and images loaded at the same time. 
    
    So we moved source media from production server to AWS S3 to reduce the server load.
