* Abstract

Some RICHKA users requested that they would like to input their
narration into the videos and recently we released a new web
application called *{{{color(red,ナレ撮り)}}}* which enables users to
record the voice as narration on web browsers and combine them with
video sources and generate videos. And *synthesis of speech
technology* to automatically generate voice data with the input texts
is also supported as *AI narration mode* and users
don't have input voice.

The screenshot below is the sample of the edit page. The upper left is
a dedicated video player to playback both a video source and recorded
narration with combining them. Users can edit the start time of cues
with dragging the cue point on the seek bar. When users click the
recording button in the lower left, the input voice is recorded
through WebRTC and it is converted to MP3 on the web browsers. The
right side is the narration texts users can add/edit. In the AI
narration mode, the voices are generated with the texts.

After the recording has been done, users click the generation button
in the upper right and it starts to generate a video with combining
the video source and the recorded voices.

* Development Environment

Web servers are based on Django, and additional 8 Python packages such
as Django extensions and boto3 to publish pre-signed S3 URL and WebVTT
parser are integrated. The current total lines of Django is around
3000 and it is still quite small because it is still beta version.
Regarding the front end, 20 OSS libraries such as jQuery, videojs,
videojs marker, RecordRTC etc. are integrated. The current total lines
of JavaScript codes is around 4300 and the font end is also still
quite small.

This product is still beta, and based on the feedback from users, new
advanced features will be continuously added and this project will
also become big service soon such as RICHKA. Regarding the synthesis
of speech technology, we will make a new post and share the detail.

* Voice Recording

One of primary features is to record voice per cue point inputted
with the mic. When users click the recording button, the recording
processing is executed with using WebRTC as a diagram below.

1. A user clicks the recording button and records the voice with mic
2. The voice data is retrieved with WebRTC API and converted into
   MP3 in JavaScript layer. Then it is directly uploaded to S3 with
   pre-signed S3 URL.
3. To enable the user to listen the recorded voice, our dedicated video
   player on JavaScript layer loads the record and initialize to be ready.
4. The user can playback the video source with overlaying the recorded
   voices without generating a new video on the dedicated video
   player.

** Direct Conversion to MP3 on JavaScript layer

At the 1st step, the MIME type of the audio data retrieved by WebRTC
is audio/webm in default and it tended to be large data size and the
quality of the voice is a bit higher quality. To adjust the quality
and the data size to match our requirements, we decided to use a
JavaScript library RecordRTC to directly convert to MP3 on JavaScript
layer and upload to S3 without delegating the conversion processing to
servers and Lambda. After we obtain the binary of MP3, we don't
convert to other formats in the data life cycle. The client processing
makes the architecture simpler and doesn't cause any additional load
to the server side.

** Dedicated video player to sync video and voices

At the 3rd step, we implemented a dedicated video player to playback
the video source with overlaying the recorded voices without
generating another video. The advantage is users can immediately check
the recording results without waiting for several seconds to generate
new videos. The dedicated video player has internally two players to
playback with synchronizing the video source and the recorded voices.

When the current seek point reaches the next cue point, the video
player loads the corresponding voice data from S3 and make the video
player ready to play.

* Video Generation

After users have inputted the voices to cue points, user are ready to
generate videos with overlying recorded voices. The generated ones
can be downloaded as independent video file.

When users click the generation button, the generation process is
executed on one of dedicated video servers as steps below.

1. When a user click the generation button, an HTTP POST request is
   sent to one of web servers behind of a load balancer.
2. The web server retrieves the location of the corresponding voices
   of S3 and sends an HTTP request to one of video servers.
3. The video server downloads the video source and the recorded voice
   files from S3, and generate an MP4 video with overlying the voices
   over the video source with using ffmpeg.
4. The video server uploads the generated video to S3 with pre-singed S3 URL.

At 3rd step to generate the video, the simplified sample command of
ffmpeg is like below.

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank
Each recorded voice stream is overlaid over the audio stream of
the video source with [[https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#amerge-1][*amerge*]] command to multiplex.

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank
And they are concatenated into one audio stream with [[https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#concat][*concat*]] command
as "[m1][s1][m2][s2][m3][m4][s3]concat=n=7:v=0:a=1[out]" in the
filter_complex option.

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank
To keep the original video stream of the video source, the video
stream is directly copied to the output stream with enabling stream
copy mode with [[https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Stream-copy][*-c:vcopy*]] option. It can avoid needless encoding of
video stream and suppress CPU usage, therefore this command can be
rapidly done.

#+BEGIN_SRC
ffmpeg -i 'vide_source.mp4'
-i 'voice_1.mp3'
-i 'voice_2.mp3'
-i 'voice_3.mp3'
-i 'voice_4.mp3'
-filter_complex '[0:a]atrim=start=0.0:duration=1.87,aformat=sample_fmts=fltp:sample_rates=44100:

-c:v copy -map 0:v -map [out] 'out.mp4'
#+END_SRC

The figure below represents how merging and concatenating audio
streams work with the ffmpeg command. The concatenated audio stream is
accumulated into an output stream [out] in the command. Then, it is
combined with the video stream of the video source with *-c:v copy
-map 0:v -map [out]* and the final result is serialized into a file
out.mp4.
