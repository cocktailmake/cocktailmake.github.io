* Abstract
Almost of the video data consists of the binary data of video and
audio streams, but the video format such as AVI(.avi), MPEG-4(.mp4)
and QuickTime File Format(.mov) etc. support to embed key/value pairs
of *metadata* into video binary because the formats have the dedicated area
to embed.

The benefit to embed the metadata is to keep the application data in
portable without having an external file. Even if we distribute the
video file on the web, the metadata will not be lost and keep in
stable.  The metadata is officially standardized and general video
player can understand them and no harm in the playback.

In RICHKA, we integrate some metadata into the generated videos to be
available in our future applications.  For examples, we integrate an
id of video template used in the video generation to enable to locate
even if the videos are distributed.

The keys supported by each container format are described below.
Based on the format, the keys are different, but we can easily integrate with ~ffmpeg~.

* Integrating metadata into Video
The sample below is to embed metadata with ~ffmpeg~ such as the name of the encoding tool,
the video title and the id of video format used.
We can suppress the needless transcode by simply copying video/audio streams with
the options ~-c:a copy -c:v copy~.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ffmpeg -y -i test.mp4 \
  -metadata encoding_tool='RICHKA' \
  -metadata description='{"format_id":"00123"}' \
  -metadata title="Sample Title" \
  -c:a copy -c:v copy out.mp4
#+END_SRC

* Retrieving metadata from video
There are some Linux commands to retrieve the metadata.

The 1st option is ~ffprobe~ which is automatically installed with ~ffmpeg~.
In the output log, there is a section ~Metadada~ including the key/value pairs.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ffprobe out.mp4

...
  Metadata:
    major_brand     : isom
    minor_version   : 512
    compatible_brands: isomiso2avc1mp41
    title           : Sample Title
    encoder         : RICHKA
    description     : {"format_id":"00123"}
...
#+END_SRC

2nd option is to use ~AtomicParsley~ with a command option ~-t~.
It simply show the raw data of the key/value pairs.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ AtomicParsley out.mp4 -t
Atom "©nam" contains: Sample Title
Atom "©too" contains: RICHKA
Atom "desc" contains: {"format_id":"00123"}
#+END_SRC

This is not recommended to use in general,
but 3rd option is to use the powerful ~strings~ to print the sequences of printable characters in any files.
The metadata was integrated into the final area in the video binary.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ cat strings out.mp4
...
data
Sample Title
data
RICHKA
-desc
%data
{"format_id":"00123"}
...
#+END_SRC
